1. Scalars & Vectors
   -> Scalar is a single number, denoted as x

   -> Vector is an array of scalars, denoted by x.
      -> Thus, a vector  has n scalars x1, x2, .. xn
      -> Note that indexing here begins with 1, unlike python (where it begins with 0)
      -> Generally these are column vector

2. Matrices & Tensors
   -> Matrix is a 2D array of scalars, denoted by x
      -> This matrix has m rows and n columns
      -> Each individual element such as X1,1 is a scalars
      -> If m = n, the matrix is known as Square Matrix

   -> Tensor is an array with more than 2 axes, denoted as X(Capital)
      -> Think of Tensor as a generalization of an array with more than 2 axes

3. Transpose
   -> For a 2D matrix tranapose can be obtainded as follows (AT)i,j = Ai,j

4. Broadcasting
   -> You can add a scalar to a vector, and numpy will add it to each element in the vector
      x + a = xi + a
   -> Similary you can add a vector to a matrix, and numpy will add the vector to each column of the matrix

5. Matrix Multiplication
   -> Ci,j = Ek Ai,k Bk,j

Linear Algebra Library with Numpy -> https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.linalg.html

6. Norms
   -> Norm can be thought of as a proxy for size of a vector
   L2 = sqrt(E xi^2)
   Lp = pow(E |xi|^p, 1/p)
   -> L2 norm is called the Euclidean Norm

7. Determinants

8. Inverse

9. Solve a System of Equations
