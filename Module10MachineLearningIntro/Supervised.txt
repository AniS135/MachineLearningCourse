Supervised learning

Training =>

-> Learn from data (labelled)
-> Generalise predictions on future data
-> avoid "OVERFITTING"

Output =>

-> Regression [Continuous] Example -> Housing, Cgpa, Stock Price
   Goal to minimize loss(erro)
-> Classification [Discrete label]
   Goal to minimize the number of misclassification 

Training Data -> Algorithm -> Hypothesis(h)

Unseen Data -> h -> predictions

h -> function having parameters
