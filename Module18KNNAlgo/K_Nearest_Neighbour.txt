k-NN [K Nearest Neighbours]

-> Simple Machine learning algorithm
-> Classification & Regression
-> Supervisied learning
-> Majority Vote
-> No Training O(1)
-> All the work happens at query time O(Nlog(N) * Q)

-> Non - Parametric
-> Baseline (Any other algorithm in machine learning should have higher accuracy than k-NN)
